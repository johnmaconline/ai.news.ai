# Big Announcements

Prioritize major launches, policy actions, partnerships, acquisitions, and high-impact funding events.

Writing guidance:
- Lead with what changed today and who announced it.
- Emphasize scope, distribution, security/compliance impact, and who is affected.
- Include concrete signals when available (rollout, pricing, geography, customer segment).
- Keep tone neutral and factual.
