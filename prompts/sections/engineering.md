# Engineering

Focus on practical engineering execution: coding workflows, agents, infra, evals, reliability, and shipping velocity.

Writing guidance:
- Highlight implementation detail over marketing language.
- Call out benchmarks, failure modes, tooling constraints, and integration complexity.
- Prefer concrete techniques engineers can copy.
- Note workforce or role implications when directly relevant.
