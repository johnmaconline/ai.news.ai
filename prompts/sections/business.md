# Software Development

Focus on practical software development execution: real agent workflows, implementation patterns, and developer-facing how-to guidance.

Writing guidance:
- Prioritize actionable implementation over general strategy.
- Highlight specific tools, skills, and step-by-step workflow patterns.
- Surface what a developer can actually apply this week.
- Favor concrete examples, benchmarks, repos, and reproducible techniques.
