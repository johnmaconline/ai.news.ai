# Business

Focus on AI-native business outcomes: monetization, margins, growth durability, distribution, and strategic advantage.

Writing guidance:
- Prioritize real business signal over vanity metrics.
- Call out revenue model, cost structure, pricing shifts, and operating leverage.
- Highlight risks to defensibility, customer concentration, or regulatory exposure.
- Keep summaries useful to founders, operators, and investors.
