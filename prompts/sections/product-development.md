# Product Development

Focus on how product teams use AI to discover, prioritize, design, and ship outcomes faster.

Writing guidance:
- Emphasize user impact, iteration speed, and decision quality.
- Surface changes in PM workflow, UX process, experimentation, and cross-functional collaboration.
- Prefer practical product patterns over pure technical detail.
- Keep recommendations actionable for product leaders.
